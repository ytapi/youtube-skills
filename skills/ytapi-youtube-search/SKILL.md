# YouTube search

Search YouTube from the agent with [YTAPI](https://ytapi.dev/?utm_source=skill), then pull transcripts of what you find.

## Setup

If `YTAPI_API_KEY` is not set, read [references/auth-setup.md](references/auth-setup.md)
and follow it: the user either pastes a key or you create a free account
with their email (200 credits, no card). Send the key as
`Authorization: Bearer $YTAPI_API_KEY` and never print it.

## Search (1 credit per page)

```bash
curl -s -G "https://api.ytapi.dev/v1/search" \
  --data-urlencode "q=QUERY" -d type=video -d limit=20 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $YTAPI_API_KEY"
```

| Param | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `q` | Search text |
| `type` | `all`, `video`, `channel`, `playlist`, `shorts`, `movie` |
| `upload_date` | `hour`, `today`, `week`, `month`, `year` |
| `duration` | `short` (under 4 min), `medium`, `long` (over 20 min) |
| `sort_by` | `relevance`, `upload_date`, `view_count`, `rating` |
| `limit` | Results per page, 1 to 50 (default 20) |
| `cursor` | `next_cursor` from the previous page, when `has_more` is true |

Results are in `items`: `id`, `type`, `title`, `author`, `channel_id`,
`length_seconds`, `view_count_text`, `published_text`.

Free autocomplete: `GET /v1/search/suggestions?q=TEXT`.

## Then read the videos (1 credit each)

```bash
curl -s "https://api.ytapi.dev/v1/transcripts?video_id=VIDEO_ID&format=text" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $YTAPI_API_KEY"
```

Pick the few most relevant results by title, channel and length before
fetching transcripts; each transcript costs a credit.

## Credits and errors

Only successful responses use credits; errors are free. New accounts get 200
free credits. Until a credit pack is bought, a key can make 1 request per
second and 100 per day (UTC); `429 daily_limit_exceeded` means that day's
limit is used up (it resets at 00:00 UTC; any pack removes it).
`402 insufficient_credits` means the balance is empty: packs from $9 at
https://ytapi.dev/?utm_source=skill#pricing. `401` means the key is missing or wrong.

For video details, search, channels, playlists and batches in one skill,
install `ytapi`. Full reference: https://docs.ytapi.dev
