# YouTube channels and playlists

Channels and playlists from [YTAPI](https://ytapi.dev/?utm_source=skill): profiles, uploads and playlist contents.

## Setup

If `YTAPI_API_KEY` is not set, read [references/auth-setup.md](references/auth-setup.md)
and follow it: the user either pastes a key or you create a free account
with their email (200 credits, no card). Send the key as
`Authorization: Bearer $YTAPI_API_KEY` and never print it.

## Channels (1 credit each)

`CHANNEL` is an `@handle` or a `UC...` ID.

```bash
# Profile: title, handle, description, subscriber and video counts
curl -s "https://api.ytapi.dev/v1/channels/CHANNEL" -H "Authorization: Bearer $YTAPI_API_KEY"

# Latest uploads
curl -s "https://api.ytapi.dev/v1/channels/CHANNEL/latest" -H "Authorization: Bearer $YTAPI_API_KEY"

# All uploads, paged; sort_by: newest (default), popular, oldest
curl -s "https://api.ytapi.dev/v1/channels/CHANNEL/videos?sort_by=popular" -H "Authorization: Bearer $YTAPI_API_KEY"

# The channel's playlists
curl -s "https://api.ytapi.dev/v1/channels/CHANNEL/playlists" -H "Authorization: Bearer $YTAPI_API_KEY"
```

## Playlists (1 credit per page)

```bash
curl -s "https://api.ytapi.dev/v1/playlists/PLAYLIST_ID" -H "Authorization: Bearer $YTAPI_API_KEY"
```

## Paging

Paged responses carry `has_more` and `next_cursor`. Pass
`cursor=NEXT_CURSOR` to get the next page. Stop when you have enough: every
page costs a credit.

## Transcripts of the videos (1 credit each)

```bash
curl -s "https://api.ytapi.dev/v1/transcripts?video_id=VIDEO_ID&format=text" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $YTAPI_API_KEY"
```

For more than a handful of videos, use one batch (up to 100 tasks, 1 credit
per successful task): `POST /v1/batch`, then poll `GET /v1/batch/{id}`.
See https://docs.ytapi.dev/batch/run.

## Credits and errors

Only successful responses use credits; errors are free. New accounts get 200
free credits. Until a credit pack is bought, a key can make 1 request per
second and 100 per day (UTC); `429 daily_limit_exceeded` means that day's
limit is used up (it resets at 00:00 UTC; any pack removes it).
`402 insufficient_credits` means the balance is empty: packs from $9 at
https://ytapi.dev/?utm_source=skill#pricing. `401` means the key is missing or wrong.

For video details, search, channels, playlists and batches in one skill,
install `ytapi`. Full reference: https://docs.ytapi.dev
