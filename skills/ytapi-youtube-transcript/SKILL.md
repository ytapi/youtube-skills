# YouTube transcripts

Transcripts and subtitles for any YouTube video with captions, from [YTAPI](https://ytapi.dev).

## Setup

If `YTAPI_API_KEY` is not set, read [references/auth-setup.md](references/auth-setup.md)
and follow it: the user either pastes a key or you create a free account
with their email (200 credits, no card). Send the key as
`Authorization: Bearer $YTAPI_API_KEY` and never print it.

## Get a transcript (1 credit)

```bash
curl -s "https://api.ytapi.dev/v1/transcripts?video_id=VIDEO_ID_OR_URL&format=text" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $YTAPI_API_KEY"
```

| Param | Default | Values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `video_id` | required | 11-character ID or a YouTube URL |
| `format` | `segments` | `text`, `markdown`, `segments` (JSON with start/end seconds), `sentences`, `srt`, `vtt`, `word_timestamps` |
| `languages` | `*` | Comma-separated codes in order of preference; `*` is the video's own language. `en,*` = English if available, else the original |
| `word_level` | `false` | Word timings on auto-generated tracks (with `format=word_timestamps`) |

- Use `format=text` or `markdown` to read, summarize or quote; `segments`
  when you need timestamps (link a moment as `https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID?t=SECONDS`);
  `srt` or `vtt` for subtitle files.
- Which languages exist, for free: `GET /v1/videos/VIDEO_ID/basic-info`
  (`available_languages`, each `manual` or `asr`).
- Long videos give long transcripts: save to a file and read it in parts.
- `404 language_not_found` / `captions_disabled`: no captions in those
  languages, or none at all. Try `languages=*`.

## Credits and errors

Only successful responses use credits; errors are free. New accounts get 200
free credits. Until a credit pack is bought, a key can make 1 request per
second and 100 per day (UTC); `429 daily_limit_exceeded` means that day's
limit is used up (it resets at 00:00 UTC; any pack removes it).
`402 insufficient_credits` means the balance is empty: packs from $9 at
https://ytapi.dev/#pricing. `401` means the key is missing or wrong.

For video details, search, channels, playlists and batches in one skill,
install `ytapi`. Full reference: https://docs.ytapi.dev
